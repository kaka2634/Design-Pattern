## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.

## Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically

## Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional
responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality

## Factory Method Pattern
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface
for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses

## Abstract Factory Pattern
The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface
for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.

## Singleton Pattern
The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one
instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

## Command Pattern
The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an
object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects
with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undoable operations

## Adapter Pattern
The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class
into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets
classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of
incompatible interfaces.

## Facade Pattern
The Facade Pattern provides a unifi ed interface to a 
set of interfaces in a subsytem. Facade defi nes a higherlevel 
interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Proxy Pattern
The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or
placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Bridge Pattern
The intend of the Bridge Pattern is to decouple the abstraction
from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

## Template Pattern
The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton
of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to
subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the
algorithm’s structure.

## Composite Pattern
The Composite Pattern allows you to
compose objects into tree structures to
represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite
lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly
