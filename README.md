## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.

## Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically

## Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional
responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality

## Factory Method Pattern
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface
for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses

## Abstract Factory Pattern
The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface
for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.

## Singleton Pattern
The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one
instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

## Command Pattern
The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an
object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects
with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undoable operations
